1/ When to use:
- setImmediate: if we want to execute a little bit faster than using setTimeout,
 for example after a callback from I/O, setImmediate queue (check phase's queue) 
 will be visited before the setTimeout queue (timer phase's queue)  
- setTimeout: want to guarantee the code execute after certain delay

2/ Differences of process.nextTick and setImmediate 
process.nextTick uses nextTick queue which is a higher priority queue, callbacks in this queue will be executed 
before callbacks in the setImmediate queue (actually before enterring the event loop). 
So basically if we want some callbacks to be completely finished before the next I/O or timers, use nextTick
